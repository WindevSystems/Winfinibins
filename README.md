# Winfinibins
Custom commands for Linux.
## Installation
Copy and paste this command:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WindevStudios/Winfinibins/main/winfinibins-install.sh | bash
```
Alternatively, click this button (After downloading, run `bash winfinibins-install.sh`):  
[![Download Winfinibins](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winfinibins/files/latest/download)  
Winfinibins will install itself automatically.  
To test, after installation run `winfinibins-info`.
## Installing Bins
**Download the bin in question.**  
For example, to install [binfetch](https://github.com/rand0mgh/binfetch) you would get it from SourceForge (the download source). Or whatever download source the bin in question uses.  
Then, move the file from the "Downloads" folder (or whatever folder it was downloaded to) into the "winfinibins" folder.  
After this the bin will be installed. No restart necessary. Just download, move, and use.
## Creating Bins
Make a file in the ~/winfinibins folder.  
Put whatever code or bash script you want in there.  
When saving it, instead of adding a .sh extension to it, just name it whatever text you want to trigger that command.
Now run the command, if you wish.
